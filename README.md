# Python3 images scraper
This project is one of the scrapers built by me in 4 different languages.

## Pros :thumbsup:
### Documentation
Python as very mature and widely used language comes with an extensive documentation about pretty much every single core / external library.
### Multithreading
I didn't expect to say that, but multithreading in python is a breeze. With only **4 lines** of code (including the import statement) I was able to speed-up the processing about **4x**! (I'm just estimating it based on the number of cpus).
### Syntax
Python uses a very clean, easily readable, easy to learn syntax.

## Cons :thumbsdown:
I can't think of any ATM.
